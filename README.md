React components to display National Weather Service JSON Feeds

By appending `&FcstType=json` to a National Weather Service forecast page you can get a JSON that looks to nicely contain the forecast information.

For example `http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=44.098601844800385&lon=-70.69908771582459&FcstType=json` gets you the forecast for North Bridgton, Maine.
